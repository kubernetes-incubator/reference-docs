#: TokenRequest.apiVersion
msgid "APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources"

#: TokenRequestSpec.audiences
msgid "Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences."

msgid "BoundObjectRef is a reference to an object that the token will be bound to. The token will only be valid for as long as the bound object exists.

#: TokenRequestSpec.expirationSeconds
msgid "ExpirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the request. The token issuer may return a token with a different validity duration so a client needs to check the 'expiration' field in a response."

An identifier is any identifier in the intersection of the TokenReviewSpec audiences and the token's audiences. A client of the TokenReview API that sets the spec.audiences field should validate that a compatible audience identifier is returned in the status.audiences field to ensure that the TokenReview server is audience aware. If a TokenReview returns an empty status.audience field where status.authenticated is \"true\", the token is valid against the audience of the Kubernetes API server."
